            The THINICE field campaign, based from Svalbard in August 2022, provided unique observations of summertime Arctic cyclones, their coupling with cloud cover, and interactions with tropopause polar vortices and sea ice conditions. THINICE was motivated by the need to advance our understanding of these processes and to improve coupled models used to forecast weather and sea ice, as well as long-term projections of climate change in the Arctic. Two research aircraft were deployed with complementary instrumentation. The Safire ATR42 aircraft, equipped with the RALI (RAdar-LIdar) remote sensing instrumentation and in-situ cloud microphysics probes, flew in the mid-troposphere to observe the wind and multi-phase cloud structure of Arctic cyclones. The British Antarctic Survey MASIN aircraft flew at low levels measuring sea-ice properties, including surface brightness temperature, albedo and roughness, and the turbulent fluxes that mediate exchange of heat and momentum between the atmosphere and the surface. Long duration instrumented balloons, operated by WindBorne Systems, sampled meteorological conditions within both cyclones and tropospheric polar vortices across the Arctic. Several novel findings are highlighted. Intense, shallow low-level jets along warm fronts were observed within three Arctic cyclones using the Doppler radar and turbulence probes. A detailed depiction of the interweaving layers of ice crystals and supercooled liquid water in mixed-phase clouds is revealed through the synergistic combination of the Doppler radar, the lidar and in-situ microphysical probes. Measurements of near-surface turbulent fluxes combined with remote sensing measurements of sea ice properties are being used to characterize atmosphere-sea ice interactions in the marginal ice zone.},

	abstract = {An operational system for extracting ice-motion information from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAW imagery is being developed for installation at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, as part of the Alaska SAR Facility. This Geophysical Processing System (GPS) will derive ice-motion information by automated analysis of image sequences acquired by radars on the European ERS-1, Japanese ERs-1, and Cansdian RADARSAT remote sensing satellites. The algorithm consists of a novel combination of feature-based and area-based techniques for the tracking of ice floes that undergo translation and rotation between imaging-passes. The algorithm development was motivated by the requirement for a highly reliable and efficient operational system for routine production of a regular gridded matrix of ice-motion vectors. Additional complexity in image segmentation is added by the unique characteristics of the SAR data, such as speckle noise, large dynamic range, and radiometric distortions. The system performs automatic selection of the image pairs for input to the matching routines using an ice-motion estimator. The system is designed to have a daily throughput of ten image pairs. This paper describes the GPS system, including an overview of the ice motion tracking algorithm, the system architecture, and the icemotion products which will be available for distribution to geophysical data users.},

The seaice estimates compare well with similar GSFC products while also fulfilling all NOAA CDR initial operation capability (IOC) requirements, including (1) selfdescribing file format, (2) ISO 19115-2 compliant collection-level metadata, (3) Climate and Forecast (CF) compliant file-level metadata, (4) grid-cell level metadata (data quality fields), (5) fully automated and reproducible processing and (6) open online access to full documentation with version control, including source code and an algorithm theoretical basic document. The primary limitations of the GSFC products are lack of metadata and use of untracked manual corrections to the output fields. Smaller differences occur from minor variations in processing methods by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (for the CDR fields) and NASA (for the GSFC fields). The CDR concentrations do have some differences from the constituent GSFC concentrations, but trends and variability are not substantially different.},

	abstract = {Understanding sea-ice dynamics at the floe scale is crucial to comprehend polar climate systems. While continuum models are commonly used to simulate large-scale sea-ice dynamics, they have limitations in accurately representing sea-ice behaviour at small scales. DEMs, on the other hand, are well-suited for modelling the behaviour of individual ice floes but face limitations due to computational constraints. To address the limitations of both approaches while combining their strengths, we explored the feasibility of using a DEM within a continuum model, where the latter provides boundary conditions for a rectangular high-resolution DEM domain. This paper presents a feasibility study where a discrete model of a 100 × 100 km2 icefield was created using high-resolution optical satellite imagery. Sea-ice dynamics were simulated in the DEM considering environmental forces and integrating large-scale ice-drift velocities as boundary conditions. Model predictions were compared with satellite observations for ice drift and deformation parameters. This numerical approach showed potential for offering accurate, high-resolution predictions of sea ice, particularly in coastal areas and near islands, and may find applications in ice navigation and climate studies. However, further development of the DEM, along with upgrades to the coupled ocean models providing data for the ice component, may be necessary. Additionally, challenges remain to develop a two-way coupling between the DEM and a continuum model, which may be needed to improve the accuracy of large-scale simulations.},

By implementing the measures in two object-based image processing software packages, we illustrate their use in terms of automatically identifying parsimonious parameter combinations from arbitrarily large sets of segmentation results. The results show that the measures have divergent performance in terms of the identification of parameter combinations. Clustering of the results in measure space narrows the search. We illustrate combination schemes for the measures for generating rankings of segmentation results. The ranked segmentation results are illustrated and described.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to sea ice segmentation in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images by combining an edge-preserving region (EPR)-based representation with region-level MRF models. To construct the EPR-based representation of a SAR image, edge strength is measured using instantaneous coefﬁcient of variation (ICOV) upon which the watershed algorithm is applied to partition the image into primitive regions. In addition, two new metrics for quantitative assessment of region characteristics (region accuracy and region redundancy) are deﬁned and used for parameter estimation in the ICOV extraction process towards desired region characteristics. In combination with a region-level MRF, the EPR-based representation facilitates the segmentation process by largely reducing the search space of optimization process and improving parameter estimation of feature model, leading to considerable computational savings and less probability of false segmentation. The proposed segmentation method has been evaluated using a synthetic sea ice image corrupted with varying levels of speckle noise as well as real SAR sea ice images. Relative to the existing region-level MRF-based methods, testing results have demonstrated that our proposed method substantially improves the segmentation accuracy at high speckle noise and achieves on average 29\% reduction of computational time.},

	abstract = {To understand the behavior of the Seasonal Ice Zone (SIZ), which is composed of sea-ice ﬂoes of various sizes, knowledge of the ﬂoe size distribution (FSD) is important. In particular, FSD in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), controlled by wave–ice interaction, plays an important role in determining the retreating rates of sea-ice extent on a global scale because the cumulative perimeter of ﬂoes enhances melting. To improve the understanding of wave–ice interaction and subsequent effects on FSD in the MIZ, FSD measurements were conducted off East Antarctica during the second Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystems eXperiment (SIPEX-2) in late winter 2012. Since logistical reasons limited helicopter operations to two interior ice regions, FSD in the interior ice region was determined using a combination of heli-photos and MODIS satellite visible images. The possible effect of wave–ice interaction in the MIZ was examined by comparison with past results obtained in the same MIZ, with our analysis showing: (1) FSD in the interior ice region is basically scale invariant for both small- (o 100 m) and large- ( 41 km) scale regimes; (2) although fractal dimensions are quite different between these two regimes, they are both rather close to that in the MIZ; and (3) for ﬂoes o100 m in diameter, a regime shift which appeared at 20–40 m in the MIZ is absent. These results indicate that one role of wave–ice interaction is to modulate the FSD that already exists in the interior ice region, rather than directly determine it. The possibilities of ﬂoe–ﬂoe collisions and storm-induced lead formation are considered as possible formation processes of FSD in the interior pack.},

We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

We introduce a ﬁve-step methodology based on multi-scale segmentation and object relationship modelling. Hierarchical patch dynamics (HPD) is adopted as the theoretical framework to address issues of heterogeneity, scale, connectivity and quasi-equilibriums in landscapes. Remote sensing has emerged as the most useful data source for characterizing land use/land cover but a vast majority of applications rely on basic image processing concepts developed in the 1970s: one spatial scale, per-pixel classiﬁcation of a multi-scale spectral feature space. We argue that this methodology does not make sufﬁcient use of spatial concepts of neighbourhood, proximity or homogeneity. In contrast, the authors demonstrate in this article the utility of the HPD framework as a theoretical basis for landscape analysis in two different projects using alternative image processing methodologies, which try to overcome the ‘pixel-centred’ view.},

	abstract = {Measurement of perimeters of planar shapes from their digitized images is an important task of computer vision systems. A general methodology for the design of simple and accurate perimeter estimation algorithms is described. It is based on minimizing the maximum estimation error for digitized straight edges over all orientations. Two new perimeter estimators are derived and their performance is tested on digitized circles using computer simulations. The experimental results may be used to predict the performance of the algorithms on shapes with arbitrary contours of continuous curvature. The simulations also show that fast and accurate perimeter estimation is possible, even for objects that are small relative to pixel size.},

Assuming a model where pixel intensity is proportional to the coverage of a pixel, we show that the presented method provides error-free measurements of the length of straight boundary segments in the case of nonquantized pixel values. For a more realistic situation, where pixel values are quantized, we derive optimal estimates that minimize the maximal estimation error. We show that the estimate converges toward a correct value as the number of gray levels tends toward infinity. The method is easy to implement; we provide the complete pseudocode. Since the method utilizes only a small neighborhood, it is very easy to parallelize. We evaluate the estimator on a set of concave and convex shapes with known perimeters, digitized at increasing resolution. In addition, we provide an example of applicability of the method on real images, by suggesting appropriate preprocessing steps and presenting results of a comparison of the suggested method with other local approaches.},

A pixel coverage repre­ sentation is one specific type of digital fuzzy representation of a continuous image object, where the (membership) value of each pixel is (approximately) equal to the relative area of the pixel which is covered by the continuous object. Lately a number of methods for shape analysis use pixel coverage for reducing error of estimation. We introduce a novel method for estimating the projection of a shape in a given direction. The method is based on utilizing pixel coverage representation of a shape. Performance of the method is evaluated by a number of tests on synthetic objects, confirming high precision and applicability for calculation of diameter and elongation of a shape.},

In this paper, the worst-case precision errors are determined for calculating the average image location of an edge, line, and straight-edged region. For each case, it is shown how the worst-case error can be minimized as a function of the geometric parameters. These results can be used to determine the worst case error by which the location of a known shape is measured. Another application is to design shapes for use in registration, such as fiducial marks used in electronic assembly. The main conclusion of this paper is that, to achieve better precision, measurement of a straight-edged region should be made at an angle askew to the sampling axis (not 0, 45, or 90 degrees) and this should be at a certain length that is a function of this skew angle.},

For arbitrary zonal statistics, pixel counting method is an operational practice widely used for area estimation by counting the number of classified pixels and multiplying by the area represented by each pixel, though uncertainty. For large statistical regions, the error of the projection can not be neglect. Thus an rectified PC method is developed for arbitrary zonal statistics of all raster data sets. The test result shows that the method performance is stable and easy to zonal statistics.},

The KE ﬂux is enhanced in late summer to autumn in areas with seasonal sea ices in the Arctic Ocean, particularly pronounced in the upper 50 meters of the ocean during sea ice melting season. This seasonal variation is closely tied to changes in sea ice cover and how the ocean layers are structured vertically. The inverse energy cascade peaks at smaller scales (near 20 km) in the upper 50 m, whereas deeper waters exhibit maxima at larger scales (around 40 km), aligning with the multi-year seasonal cycle of eddy KE. This study highlights the role of eddies in shaping inverse energy cascades and provides new insights into multiscale energetics and eddy-mean ﬂow interactions in regions inﬂuenced by sea ice.},

	abstract = {Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is better than pixel-based image analysis for change detection (CD) in very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. Although the eﬀectiveness of deep learning approaches has recently been proved, few studies have investigated OBIA and deep learning for CD. Previously proposed methods use the object information obtained from the preprocessing and postprocessing phase of deep learning. In general, they use the dominant or most frequently used label information with respect to all the pixels inside an object without considering any quantitative criteria to integrate the deep learning network and object information. In this study, we developed an object-based CD method for VHR satellite images using a deep learning network to denote the uncertainty associated with an object and eﬀectively detect the changes in an area without the ground truth data. The proposed method deﬁnes the uncertainty associated with an object and mainly includes two phases. Initially, CD objects were generated by unsupervised CD methods, and the objects were used to train the CD network comprising three-dimensional convolutional layers and convolutional long short-term memory layers. The CD objects were updated according to the uncertainty level after the learning process was completed. Further, the updated CD objects were considered as the training data for the CD network. This process was repeated until the entire area was classiﬁed into two classes, i.e., change and no-change, with respect to the object units or deﬁned epoch. The experiments conducted using two diﬀerent VHR satellite images conﬁrmed that the proposed method achieved the best performance when compared with the performances obtained using the traditional CD approaches. The method was less aﬀected by salt and pepper noise and could eﬀectively extract the region of change in object units without ground truth data. Furthermore, the proposed method can oﬀer advantages associated with unsupervised CD methods and a CD network subjected to postprocessing by eﬀectively utilizing the deep learning technique and object information.},

Both the internal dynamics of the floe mosaic (floe-floe interactions), and the evolution of floes under ocean and atmospheric forcing (floe-flow interactions), determine the exchange of heat, momentum, and tracers between the lower atmosphere and upper ocean. Climate models do not represent either of these highly variable interactions. We use a novel, high-resolution, discrete element modeling framework to examine ice-ocean boundary layer (IOBL) turbulence within a domain approximately the size of a climate model grid. We show floe-scale effects could cause a marked increase in the production of fine-scale three-dimensional turbulence in the IOBL relative to continuum model approaches, and provide a method of representing that turbulence using bulk parameters related to the spatial variance of the ice and ocean: the floe size distribution and the ocean kinetic energy spectrum.},

	abstract = {To better describe the state of sea ice in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) with ﬂoes of varying thicknesses and sizes, both an ice thickness distribution (ITD) and a ﬂoe size distribution (FSD) are needed. In this work, we have developed a FSD theory that is coupled to the ITD theory of Thorndike et al. (1975) in order to explicitly simulate the evolution of FSD and ITD jointly. The FSD theory includes a FSD function and a FSD conservation equation in parallel with the ITD equation. The FSD equation takes into account changes in FSD due to ice advection, thermodynamic growth, and lateral melting. It also includes changes in FSD because of mechanical redistribution of ﬂoe size due to ice ridging and, particularly, ice fragmentation induced by stochastic ocean surface waves. The ﬂoe size redistribution due to ice fragmentation is based on the assumption that wave-induced breakup is a random process such that when an ice ﬂoe is broken, ﬂoes of any smaller sizes have an equal opportunity to form, without being either favored or excluded. To focus only on the properties of mechanical ﬂoe size redistribution, the FSD theory is implemented in a simpliﬁed ITD and FSD sea ice model for idealized numerical experiments. Model results show that the simulated cumulative ﬂoe number distribution (CFND) follows a power law as observed by satellites and airborne surveys. The simulated values of the exponent of the power law, with varying levels of ice breakups, are also in the range of the observations. It is found that ﬂoe size redistribution and the resulting FSD and mean ﬂoe size do not depend on how ﬂoe size categories are partitioned over a given ﬂoe size range. The ability to explicitly simulate multicategory FSD and ITD together may help to incorporate additional model physics, such as FSD-dependent ice mechanics, surface exchange of heat, mass, and momentum, and wave-ice interactions.},

	abstract = {Sea ice in the polar regions can move several tens of kilometres per day under the actions of winds, ocean currents, and internal stresses. Long-term observations of the rate and patterns of this motion are needed to characterize the full response of the polar environment to climate change. Here, we introduce a new climate data record (CDR) of year-round, global, daily sea-ice drift vectors covering 1991–2020. The motion vectors are computed from series of passive microwave imagery in the winter months and from a parametric free-drift model in the summer months. An evaluation against on-ice buoy trajectories reveals that the RMSEs of the seaice drift CDR are small and vary with hemisphere and seasons (2.1 km for Arctic winters, 2.6 km for Arctic summer, 3 to 4 km for the Antarctic sea ice). The CDR is un-biased for Arctic winter conditions. The bias is larger for Antarctic and for summer sea-ice motion. The CDR consists of daily product ﬁles holding the dX and dY components of the drift vectors on an Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE2) grid with 75 km spacing as well as associated uncertainties and ﬂags. It is prepared in the context of the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) and is readily available at https://doi.org/10.15770/EUM\_SAF\_OSI\_0012 (OSI SAF, 2022).},

The analysis is confined to the high‐concentration Arctic sea ice, where the ice cover is near 100\%. During winter the results indicate that the variability of the SSM/I concentration estimates is larger than the true variability of ice concentration. Results from a trusted subset of the SAR scenes across the central Arctic allow the separation of the ice concentration uncertainty due to emissivity variations and sensor noise from other error sources during the winter of 2003–2004. Depending on the algorithm, error standard deviations from 2.5 to 5.0\% are found with sensor noise between 1.3 and 1.8\%. This is in accord with variability estimated from analysis of SSM/I time series. Algorithms, which primarily use 85 GHz information, consistently give the best agreement with both SAR ice concentrations and ship observations. Although the 85 GHz information is more sensitive to atmospheric influences, it was found that the atmospheric contribution is secondary to the influence of the surface emissivity variability. Analysis of the entire SSM/I time series shows that there are significant differences in trend between sea ice extent and area, using different algorithms. This indicates that long‐term trends in surface and atmospheric properties, unrelated to sea ice concentration, influence the computed trends.},

Advancing technologies have profoundly improved our ability to observe Arctic sea ice, document its processes and properties, and describe atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions with unprecedented detail. Yet, our progress toward better understanding the Arctic sea ice system is mired by the stark disparities between observations that tend to be siloed by method, scientific discipline, and application. This article presents a review and philosophical design for observing sea ice and accelerating our understanding of the Arctic sea ice system. We give a brief history of Arctic sea ice observations and showcase the 2018 melt season within the context of five observational themes: spatial heterogeneity, temporal variability, cross-disciplinary science, scalability, and retrieval uncertainty. We synthesize buoy data, optical imagery, satellite retrievals, and airborne measurements to demonstrate how disparate data sets can be woven together to transcend observational-scale issues. The results show that there are limitations to interpreting any single data set alone. However, many of these limitations can be surmounted by combining observations that cross spatial and temporal scales. We conclude the article with pathways toward coordinating across observational platforms in order to: (1) optimize the scientific, operational, and community return on observational investments, and (2) facilitate a richer understanding of Arctic sea ice and its role in the climate system.},

In this study, continuous observations in the Canada Basin from March through December 2014 were used to investigate spatial differences and temporal changes in under-ice roughness and momentum transfer as the ice cover evolved seasonally. Observations of wind, ice, and ocean properties from four clusters of drifting instrument systems were complemented by direct drill-hole measurements and instrumented overhead flights by NASA operation IceBridge in March, as well as satellite remote sensing imagery about the instrument clusters. Spatially, directly estimated ice-ocean drag coefficients varied by a factor of three with rougher ice associated with smaller multi-year ice floe sizes embedded within the first-year-ice/multi-year-ice conglomerate. Temporal differences in the ice-ocean drag coefficient of 20–30\% were observed prior to the mixed layer shoaling in summer and were associated with ice concentrations falling below 100\%. The ice-ocean drag coefficient parameterization was found to be invalid in September with low ice concentrations and small ice floe sizes. Maximum momentum transfer to the ice occurred for moderate ice concentrations, and transfer to the ocean for the lowest ice concentrations and shallowest stratification. Wind work and ocean work on the ice were the dominant terms in the kinetic energy budget of the ice throughout the melt season, consistent with free drift conditions. Overall, ice topography, ice concentration, and the shallow summer mixed layer all influenced mixed layer currents and the transfer of momentum within the air-ice-ocean system. The observed changes in momentum transfer show that care must be taken to determine appropriate parameterizations of momentum transfer, and imply that the future Arctic system could become increasingly seasonal.},

	abstract = {Sea ice monitoring by polar orbiting satellites has been developed over more than four decades and is today one of the most well-established applications of space observations. This article gives an overview of data product development from the first sensors to the state-of-the-art regarding retrieval methods, new products and operational data sets serving climate monitoring as well as daily operational services including ice charting and forecasting. Passive microwave data has the longest history and represents the backbone of global ice monitoring with already more than four decades of consistent observations of ice concentration and extent. Time series of passive microwave data is the primary climate data set to document the sea ice decline in the Arctic. Scatterometer data is a valuable supplement to the passive microwave data, in particular to retrieve ice displacement and distinguish between firstyear and multiyear ice. Radar and laser altimeter data has become the main method to estimate sea ice thickness and thereby fill a gap in the observation of sea ice as an essential climate variable. Data on ice thickness allows estimation of ice volume and masses as well as improvement of the ice forecasts. The use of different altimetric frequencies also makes it possible to measure the depth of the snow covering the ice. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has become the work horse in operational ice observation on regional scale because high-resolution radar images are delivered year-round in nearly all regions where national ice services produce ice charts. Synthetic Aperture Radar data are also important for sea ice research because the data can be used to observe a number of sea ice processes and phenomena, like ice type development and sea ice dynamics, and thereby contribute to new knowledge about sea ice. The use of sea ice data products in modelling and forecasting services as well as in ice navigation is discussed. Finally, the article describes future plans for new satellites and sensors to be used in sea ice observation.},

	abstract = {Understanding the physical mechanisms behind the deformation of pack ice floes is important for understanding the dynamics of the local ice regime, and for the calibration and validation of ice dynamics models. In April 2017, six Iridium satellite-tracking beacons were deployed on six pack ice floes in the Barents Sea south of Svalbard in the Norwegian Arctic. The ice tracker deployment was performed as part of an offshore research expedition carried out onboard the Research Vessel (RV) Polarsyssel to characterize the local sea ice environ­ ment. In addition to the ice tracker deployments, an anemometer beacon, a wave beacon, and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) were deployed on a drifting ice floe to which the vessel was moored for nearly three days, and extensive thickness, salinity, and density measurements were made. The wave beacon recorded the vertical acceleration of the floe so that wave forcing on the floe drift could be estimated. The in-situ wind, ocean current, wave, and ice thickness and density measurements permitted the estimation of met-ocean forcings on the acceleration of the ice floe. On April 28, two days after the last ice tracker was deployed on April 26, the six tracked ice floes rapidly dispersed just to the west-southwest of Hopen Island. The dispersion of the ice floes was dominated by strong shearing within the local ice pack, coinciding with a rapid increase in the speeds of the local tidal currents, which was soon followed by a rapid increase in the wave energy. Each of the six tracked ice floes increased their observed drift speeds in sync with the increase in the local tidal current speeds at different times for each floe, but at approximately the same decrease in water depth as they reached the northern edge of Spitsbergen Bank. The rapid increase in the tidal currents was linked to the topographic enhancement of tidal motion near Hopen Island in the shallower waters of Spitsbergen Bank. The wind and wave measurements made by the anemometer and wave beacons and ice tracker left on the ice floe to which the vessel was moored allowed for an estimate of the relative strength of the wind, tidal, and wave forcings on the local ice field. The results showed that the tidal currents initially dominated the dynamic response of the local ice field compared to the wind, which led to the conclusion that the enhanced tidal current was ultimately the dominant cause of the initial dispersion of the local pack ice field on April 28, and the dispersion was then further enhanced by the increase in wave energy.},

	abstract = {Marginal ice zones (MIZs) are qualitatively distinct sea-ice-covered areas that play a critical role in the interaction between the polar oceans and the broader Earth system. MIZ regions have high spatial and temporal variability in oceanic, atmospheric and ecological conditions. The salient qualitative feature of MIZs is their composition as a mosaic of individual floes that range in horizontal extent from centimetres to tens of kilometres. Thus the floe size distribution (FSD) can be used to quantitatively identify and describe them. Here, the history of FSD observations and theory, and the processes (particularly the impact of ocean waves) that determine floe sizes and size distribution, are reviewed. Coupled wave-FSD feedbacks are explored using a stochastic model for thermodynamic wave-sea-ice interactions in the MIZ, and some of the key open questions in this rapidly growing field are discussed.

	abstract = {Despite enormous scientific and technological progress in numerical weather and climate prediction, sea ice still remains unreliably predicted by models, both in short-term forecasting and climate projection applications. The total ice extent in both hemispheres is tied to the location of the ice edge, and consequently to what happens in the portion of the ice cover immediately adjacent to the open ocean that is called the marginal ice zone (MIZ). There is mounting evidence that processes occurring in the MIZ might play an important role in the polar climate of both hemispheres, yet some key physical processes are still missing in models. As sea ice models developed for climate studies are increasingly used for operational forecasting, the missing physics also impede short-term sea ice prediction skills. This paper is a mini-review that provides a historical perspective on how MIZ research has progressed since the 1970s, with a focus on the fundamental importance of the interactions between sea ice and surface gravity waves on sea ice dynamics. Completeness is not achieved, as the body of literature is huge, scattered and rapidly growing, but the intention is to inform future collaborative research efforts to improve our understanding and predictive capabilities of sea ice dynamics in the MIZ.

First, we provide a history of these NASA products distributed at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Then we discuss the improvements to the algorithms, provide validation results for the new (Version 4) and older versions, and intercompare the two. While Version 4 algorithm changes were signiﬁcant, the impact on the products is relatively minor, particularly for more recent years. The changes in Version 4 reduce motion biases by ∼ 0.01 to 0.02 cm s−1 and error standard deviations by ∼ 0.3 cm s−1. Overall, ice speed increased in Version 4 over Version 3 by 0.5 to 2.0 cm s−1 over most of the time series. Version 4 shows a higher positive trend for the Arctic of 0.21 cm s−1 per decade compared to 0.13 cm s−1 per decade for Version 3. The new version of ice age estimates indicates more older ice than Version 3, especially earlier in the record, but similar trends toward less multiyear ice. Changes in sea ice motion and age derived from the product show a signiﬁcant shift in the Arctic ice cover, from a pack with a high concentration of older ice to a sea ice cover dominated by ﬁrst-year ice, which is more susceptible to summer melt. We also observe an increase in the speed of the ice over the time series ≥ 30 years, which has been shown in other studies and is anticipated with the annual decrease in sea ice extent.},

Coupling must therefore be considered across a range of scales appropriate to the time scale of the forecast, from planetary-scale dynamics to subgrid-scale processes in models. It was pointed out that better knowledge is needed as to the dominant causal direction of atmosphere-ocean-ice coupling and polar-midlatitude-tropical interactions and of their physical mechanisms, including the role of the stratosphere. In addition, the effects of model biases on projections for many of the phenomena discussed are still poorly understood. Participants pointed out that further work is required to elucidate the anthropogenic contribution to sea ice trends and to better understand the character of anthropogenic changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation. Another key message emanating from the discussion was that Arctic-midlatitude interactions are clearly two way, which complicates attribution of cause and effect. For example, Arctic amplification is itself partially a response to lower-latitude forcing. Participants suggested that future research with respect to extreme events at high latitudes should be extended to oceanography, biology, avalanches, and visibility. Furthermore, there was a general agreement to enhance stakeholder involvement with respect to polar predictability. Last, workshop participants pinpointed the importance of process-based studies to make progress on research questions where insufficient observations and/or inadequate models hamper assessment of larger temporal- and spatial-scale processes.},

Current parameterization schemes used in the weather and climate models are compared with our results and the majority are found to be physically unjustified and unrepresentative. The Lüpkes et al. (2012) scheme is recommended in a computationally simple form, with adjusted parameter settings. A good agreement is found to hold for subsets of the data from different locations despite differences in sea ice conditions. Ice conditions in the Barents Sea, characterised by small, unconsolidated ice floes, are found to be associated with higher {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}textgreaterC{\textbackslash}textless/i{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreaterDN10{\textbackslash}textless/sub{\textbackslash}textgreater values – especially at the higher ice fractions – than those of Fram Strait, where typically larger, smoother floes are observed.

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a model describing the dynamics of a population of ice ﬂoes with arbitrary shapes and sizes, which are exposed to atmospheric and oceanic skin drag. The granular model presented is based on simpliﬁed momentum equations for ice ﬂoe motion between collisions and on the resolution of linear complementarity problems to deal with ice ﬂoe collisions. Between collisions, the motion of an individual ice ﬂoe satisﬁes the linear and angular momentum conservation equations, with classical formula applied to account for atmospheric and oceanic skin drag. To deal with collisions, before they lead to interpenetration, we included a linear complementarity problem based on the Signorini condition and Coulombs law. The nature of the contact is described through a constant coefﬁcient of friction l, as well as a coefﬁcient of restitution ð0 e 1Þ describing the loss of kinetic energy during the collision. In the present version of our model, this coefﬁcient is ﬁxed. The model was validated using data obtained from the motion of interacting artiﬁcial wood ﬂoes in a test basin. The results of simulations comprising few hundreds of ice ﬂoes of various shapes and sizes, exposed to different forcing scenarios, and under different conﬁgurations, are also discussed. They show that the progressive clustering of ice ﬂoes as the result of kinetic energy dissipation during collisions is well captured, and suggest a collisional regimes of ﬂoe dispersion at small scales, different from a large-scale regime essentially driven by wind forcing.},

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery spanning over almost two decades of daily observations at a resolution of up to 250 m provides a good resource for deriving long-term ocean kinematics from sea ice dynamics. In this paper, we present a newly developed automatic algorithm to retrieve dynamic measurements of sea ice from these images. We describe the methodology by presenting results acquired along the East Greenland Current (ECG) for 6.5 weeks in the spring of 2017. During this period, our ice floe tracker was used to identify and track ice floes with length scales ranging from 8 to 65 km. By effectively filtering atmospheric conditions from MODIS images, ice floes were tracked for up to ten consecutive days, and a total of 1061 trajectories were retrieved. A southward mean sea ice flow associated with the ECG was observed along with deviations in both direction and magnitude, suggesting the effect of an underlying turbulent eddy field. The absolute position and tracking errors associated with our method are 255 m and 0.65 cm/s, respectively, each derived from a comparison between manually and automatically identified ice floes. Going forward, our methodology will be employed to process longer time sequences to analyze nonlinear interactions between drifting ice floes and the upper ocean turbulent eddy field in the ECG as well as to investigate other prominent regions of the Arctic Ocean.},

This study presents an assessment of sensitivity experiments performed with different sea ice products in a convective-scale weather forecasting system for the European Arctic. On kilometer-scale resolution sea ice products are challenged by the large footprint of passive microwave satellite observations and issues with spurious sea ice detection of the higher-resolution retrievals based on synthetic aperture radar instruments. We perform sensitivity experiments with sea ice concentration ﬁelds of 1) the global ECMWF-IFS forecast system, 2) a newly developed multisensor product processed through a coupled sea ice–ocean forecasting system, and 3) the AMSR2 product based on passive microwave observations. There are signiﬁcant differences between the products on O(100) km scales in the northern Barents Sea and along the Marginal Ice Zone north of the Svalbard archipelago and toward the Fram Strait. These differences have a direct impact on the modeled surface skin temperature over ocean and sea ice, the turbulent heat ﬂux, and 2-m air temperature (T2M). An assessment of Arctic weather stations shows a signiﬁcant improvement of forecasted T2M in the north and east of Svalbard when using the new multisensor product; however, south of Svalbard this product has a negative impact. The different sea ice products are resulting in changes of the surface turbulent heat ﬂux of up to 400 W m22, which in turn results in T2M variations of up to 58C. Over a 2-day forecast lead time this can lead to uncertainties in weather forecasts of about 18C even hundreds of kilometers away from the sea ice.},

In this study, we propose an optical ﬂow and super-resolution approach to accurately estimate motion from remote sensing images at a higher spatial resolution than the original data. First, an external example learning-based super-resolution method is applied on the original images to generate higher resolution versions. Then, an optical ﬂow approach is applied on the higher resolution images, identifying sparse correspondences and interpolating them to extract a dense motion vector ﬁeld with continuous values and subpixel accuracies. Our proposed approach is successfully evaluated on passive microwave, optical, and Synthetic Aperture Radar data, proving appropriate for multi-sensor applications and different spatial resolutions. The approach estimates motion with similar or higher accuracy than the original data, while increasing the spatial resolution of up to eight times. In addition, the adopted optical ﬂow component outperforms a state-of-the-art pattern matching method. Overall, the proposed approach results in accurate motion vectors with unprecedented spatial resolutions of up to 1.5 km for passive microwave data covering the entire Arctic and 20 m for radar data, and proves promising for numerous scientiﬁc and operational applications.},

	abstract = {High resolution aerial photographs used to detect and classify sea ice features can provide accurate physical parameters to reﬁne, validate, and improve climate models. However, manually delineating sea ice and melt ponds is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, an object-based classiﬁcation algorithm is developed to automatically extract sea ice and melt ponds efﬁciently from 163 aerial photographs taken during the Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition in summer 2010 (CHINARE 2010) in the Arctic Paciﬁc Sector. The photographs are selected from 599 cloud-free photographs based on their image quality and representativeness in the marginal ice zone (MIZ). The algorithm includes three major steps: (1) the image segmentation groups the neighboring pixels into objects according to the similarity of spectral and textural information; (2) the random forest ensemble classiﬁer distinguishes four general classes: water, general submerged ice (GSI, including melt ponds and submerged ice along ice edges), shadow, and ice/snow; and (3) the polygon neighbor analysis further separates melt ponds and submerged ice from the GSI according to their spatial relationships. The overall classiﬁcation accuracy for the four general classes is 95.5\% based on 178 ground reference objects. Furthermore, the producer's accuracy of 90.8\% and user's accuracy of 91.8\% are achieved for melt pond detection through 98 independent reference objects. For the 163 photos examined, a total of 19,438 melt ponds larger than 1 m2 are detected, with a pond density of 867.2 km−2, mean pond size of 32.6 ± 0.03 m2, and mean pond fraction of 0.06 ± 0.006; a total of 42,468 ice ﬂoes are detected, with the mean ﬂoe size of 173.3 ± 0.1 m2 (majority in 1–30 m2) and mean ice concentration of 46.1 ± 0.5\% (ranging from 18.6–98.6\%). These results matched well with ship-based visual observations in the MIZ in the same area and time. The method presented in the paper can be applied to data sets of high spatial resolution Arctic sea ice photographs for deriving detailed sea ice concentration, ﬂoe size, and melt pond distributions over wider regions, and extracting sea ice physical parameters and their corresponding changes between years.},

	abstract = {Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) has drawn increasing attention from scientists in recent years because of its fast decline in the Boreal summer and early fall. The measurement of SIE is derived from remote sensing data and is both a lagged and leading indicator of climate change. To characterize at a local level the decline in SIE, we use remote-sensing data at 25 km resolution to ﬁt a spatio-temporal logistic autoregressive model of the sea-ice evolution in the Arctic region. The model incorporates last year’s ice/water binary observations at nearby grid cells in an autoregressive manner with autoregressive coefﬁcients that vary both in space and time. Using the model-based estimates of ice/water probabilities in the Arctic region, we propose several graphical summaries to visualize the spatio-temporal changes in Arctic sea ice beyond what can be visualized with the single time series of SIE. In ever-higher latitude bands, we observe a consistently declining temporal trend of sea ice in the early fall. We also observe a clear decline in and contraction of the sea ice’s distribution between 70◦N–75◦N, and of most concern is that this may reﬂect the future behavior of sea ice at ever-higher latitudes under climate change.},

The advent of coupled wave–ice modeling and discrete-element modeling, together with improved and expanded satellite observations and field campaigns, has yielded advances in process understanding. Many topics remain in need of further investigation, including rheologies appropriate for seasonal sea ice, wave-induced sea ice fracture, welding for sea ice freezeup, and the distribution of snow on seasonal sea ice.

Accurately tracking sea ice motions is essential to validate or even improve sea ice models for ice hazard forecasts at a ﬁne scale. Fine-scale motions can be tracked from high-resolution radar or optical satellite imagery but with limited coverage. Daily motions over the entire Arctic are retrievable from passive microwave data, but at a much lower spatial resolution. Thus, providing motions at the passive microwave spatial and temporal coverage, but at an enhanced spatial resolution, will be a signiﬁcant beneﬁt. To break the resolution limitation and to boost tracking accuracy, a sequential super-resolved ﬁne-scale sea ice motion tracking framework is proposed in which a hybrid example-based single image superresolution algorithm is employed before the tracking procedure. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework signiﬁcantly improves the tracking performance in both accuracy and robustness for a benchmark algorithm and a recently proposed state-of-the-art tracking algorithm.},

	abstract = {Object-based image classiﬁcation for land-cover mapping purposes using remote-sensing imagery has attracted signiﬁcant attention in recent years. Numerous studies conducted over the past decade have investigated a broad array of sensors, feature selection, classiﬁers, and other factors of interest. However, these research results have not yet been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the effect of different supervised object-based land-cover classiﬁcation processes. In this study, we ﬁrst construct a database with 28 ﬁelds using qualitative and quantitative information extracted from 254 experimental cases described in 173 scientiﬁc papers. Second, the results of the meta-analysis are reported, including general characteristics of the studies (e.g., the geographic range of relevant institutes, preferred journals) and the relationships between factors of interest (e.g., spatial resolution and study area or optimal segmentation scale, accuracy and number of targeted classes), especially with respect to the classiﬁcation accuracy of different sensors, segmentation scale, training set size, supervised classiﬁers, and landcover types. Third, useful data on supervised object-based image classiﬁcation are determined from the meta-analysis. For example, we ﬁnd that supervised object-based classiﬁcation is currently experiencing rapid advances, while development of the fuzzy technique is limited in the object-based framework. Furthermore, spatial resolution correlates with the optimal segmentation scale and study area, and Random Forest (RF) shows the best performance in object-based classiﬁcation. The area-based accuracy assessment method can obtain stable classiﬁcation performance, and indicates a strong correlation between accuracy and training set size, while the accuracy of the point-based method is likely to be unstable due to mixed objects. In addition, the overall accuracy beneﬁts from higher spatial resolution images (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle) or agricultural sites where it also correlates with the number of targeted classes. More than 95.6\% of studies involve an area less than 300 ha, and the spatial resolution of images is predominantly between 0 and 2 m. Furthermore, we identify some methods that may advance supervised object-based image classiﬁcation. For example, deep learning and type-2 fuzzy techniques may further improve classiﬁcation accuracy. Lastly, scientists are strongly encouraged to report results of uncertainty studies to further explore the effects of varied factors on supervised objectbased image classiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Mapping sea ice in the Arctic is essential for maritime navigation, and growing vessel traffic highlights the necessity of the timeliness and accuracy of sea ice charts. In addition, with the increased availability of satellite imagery, automation is becoming more important. The AutoICE Challenge investigates the possibility of creating deep learning models capable of mapping multiple sea ice parameters automatically from spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and assesses the current state of the automatic-sea-ice-mapping scientific field. This was achieved by providing the tools and encouraging participants to adopt the paradigm of retrieving multiple sea ice parameters rather than the current focus on single sea ice parameters, such as concentration. The paper documents the efforts and analyses, compares, and discusses the performance of the top-five participants’ submissions. Participants were tasked with the development of machine learning algorithms mapping the total sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size using a state-of-the-art sea ice dataset with dual-polarised Sentinel-1 SAR images and 22 other relevant variables while using professionally labelled sea ice charts from multiple national ice services as reference data. The challenge had 129 teams representing a total of 179 participants, with 34 teams delivering 494 submissions, resulting in a participation rate of 26.4 \%, and it was won by a team from the University of Waterloo. Participants were successful in training models capable of retrieving multiple sea ice parameters with convolutional neural networks and vision transformer models. The top participants scored best on the total sea ice concentration and stage of development, while the floe size was more difficult. Furthermore, participants offered intriguing approaches and ideas that could help propel future research within automatic sea ice mapping, such as applying high downsampling of SAR data to improve model efficiency and produce better results.},

	abstract = {The continued loss of sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere due to global warming poses a threat to biota and human activities, evidencing the necessity of efﬁcient sea ice monitoring tools. Aiming at the creation of an improved sea ice extent indicator covering the European regional seas, the new IceMap500 algorithm has been developed to classify sea ice and water at a resolution of 500 m at nadir. IceMap500 features a classiﬁcation strategy built upon previous MODIS sea ice extent algorithms and a new method to reclassify areas affected by resolution-breaking features inherited from the MODIS cloud mask. This approach results in an enlargement of mapped area, a reduction of potential error sources and a better delineation of the sea ice edge, while still systematically achieving accuracies above 90 \%, as obtained by manual validation. Swath maps have been aggregated at a monthly scale to obtain sea ice extent with a method that is sensitive to spatio-temporal variations in the sea ice cover and that can be used as an additional error ﬁlter. The resulting dataset, covering the months of maximum and minimum sea ice extent (i.e. March and September) over 2 decades (from 2000 to 2019), demonstrates the algorithm’s applicability as a monitoring tool and as an indicator, illustrating the sea ice decline at a regional scale. The European sea regions located in the Arctic, NE Atlantic and Barents seas display clear negative trends in both March (−27.98 ± 6.01 × 103 km2yr−1) and September (−16.47 ± 5.66 × 103 km2yr−1). Such trends indicate that the sea ice cover is shrinking at a rate of ∼ 9 \% and ∼ 13 \% per decade, respectively, even though the sea ice extent loss is comparatively ∼ 70 \% greater in March.},

Furthermore, reliable lead and floe discrimination is essential for the calculation of sea ice freeboard and thickness from satellite altimetry. Despite its value for shipping, the Northwest Passage is commonly excluded from Arctic-wide satellite altimetry sea ice observations owing to the challenges of obtaining accurate retrievals in the region. Here, we map the distribution of leads and floes in the Northwest Passage using Landsat 8 satellite optical imagery, and we use these to evaluate the efficacy of near-coincident classifications from CryoSat-2 satellite radar altimetry. We test different pulse peakiness and stack standard deviation thresholds for discriminating returns from CryoSat-2 into leads and floes, and assess the agreement with near-coincident Landsat 8 estimates. CryoSat-2 lead and floe densities are, on average, 14\% higher and 45\% lower than Landsat 8, respectively. We attribute the difference to a range of factors including the coarser spatial sampling of CryoSat-2 which results in mixed surface types within the radar footprint, off-nadir ranging of leads, and the misidentification of sea ice floes as ambiguous surface type. In particular we find the poorest agreement in October, when the ice pack is fragile after the summer melt season. We use our findings to develop a bias adjustment to bring CryoSat-2 lead and floe density estimates in line with Landsat 8, reducing the root mean square difference between them from 20\% to 5\% and 47\% to 6\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Wave‐ice interactions are critical for correctly modeling air‐sea exchanges and ocean surface processes in polar regions. While the role of sea ice in damping open‐water swell waves has received considerable research interest, the impact of sea ice on locally generated wind‐waves in partial ice cover remains uncertain. The current approach in spectral wave models is to scale the wind input term by the open‐water fraction, 1 ϕ, for ϕ the sea ice concentration (SIC), but this neglects the impact of subgrid‐scale patterns of sea ice coverage in limiting fetch for wind‐wave growth. Here, we use the spectral wave model SWAN to simulate local waves in realistic, synthetic fields of explicitly resolved sea ice floes over a range of SICs and floe size distributions (FSDs). We consider cases with floe sizes much larger than the wavelengths, and absent of interstitial frazil or pancake ice. Through geometric arguments, we show that the fetch available for wind‐wave growth, and thus the resulting wave statistics, depends on a combination of the SIC and the FSD. The combination of geometric scaling and empirical wave laws allows the prediction of bulk wave statistics as a function of SIC, a characteristic floe size, and wind speed. We show that due to the difference in spectral character from attenuated propagating open‐ocean swell, these waves may have an outsized impact on ocean mixing regimes.},

	abstract = {Eddies within the meso/submeso-scale range are prevalent throughout the Arctic Ocean, playing a pivotal role in regulating freshwater budget, heat transfer, and sea ice transport. While observations have suggested a strong connection between the dynamics of sea ice and the underlying turbulent flows, quantifying this relationship remains an ambitious task due to the challenges of acquiring concurrent sea ice and ocean measurements. Recently, an innovative study using a unique algorithm to track sea ice floes showed that ice floes can be used as vorticity-meters of the ocean. Here, we present a numerical and analytical evaluation of this result by estimating the kinematic link between free-drifting ice floes and underlying ocean eddies using idealized vortex models. These analyses are expanded to explore local eddies in quasi-geostrophic turbulence, providing a more realistic representation of eddies in the Arctic Ocean. We find that in both flow fields, the relationship between floe rotation rates and ocean vorticity depends on the relative size of the ice floe to the eddy. As the floe size approaches and exceeds the eddy size, the floe rotation rates depart from half of the ocean vorticity. Finally, the effects of ice floe thickness, atmospheric winds, and floe-floe collisions on floe rotations are investigated. The derived relations and floe statistics set the foundation for leveraging remote sensing observations of floe motions to characterize eddy vorticity at small to moderate scales. This innovative approach opens new possibilities for quantifying Arctic Ocean eddy characteristics, providing valuable inputs for more accurate climate projections.},

	abstract = {Object-based image analysis (OBIA) has been widely adopted as a common paradigm to deal with very high-resolution remote sensing images. Nevertheless, OBIA methods strongly depend on the results of image segmentation. Many segmentation quality metrics have been proposed. Supervised metrics give accurate quality estimation but require a ground-truth segmentation as reference. Unsupervised metrics only make use of intrinsic image and segment properties; yet most of them strongly depend on the application and do not deal well with the variability of objects in remote sensing images. Furthermore, the few metrics developed in a remote sensing context mainly focus on global evaluation. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised metric, which evaluates local quality (per segment) by analyzing segment neighborhood, thus quantifying under- and over-segmentation given a certain homogeneity criterion. Additionally, we propose two variants of this metric, for estimating global quality of remote sensing image segmentation by the aggregation of local quality scores. Finally, we analyze the behavior of the proposed metrics and validate their applicability for ﬁnding segmentation results having good tradeoff between both kinds of errors.},

These approaches to analysing imagery have antecedents in earlier research on image segmentation and use GIS-like spatial analysis within classiﬁcation and feature extraction approaches. This article investigates these development and its implications and asks whether or not this is a new paradigm in remote sensing and Geographic Information Science (GIScience). We ﬁrst discuss several limitations of prevailing per-pixel methods when applied to high resolution images. Then we explore the paradigm concept developed by Kuhn (1962) and discuss whether GEOBIA can be regarded as a paradigm according to this deﬁnition. We crystallize core concepts of GEOBIA, including the role of objects, of ontologies and the multiplicity of scales and we discuss how these conceptual developments support important methods in remote sensing such as change detection and accuracy assessment. The ramiﬁcations of the different theoretical foundations between the ‘per-pixel paradigm’ and GEOBIA are analysed, as are some of the challenges along this path from pixels, to objects, to geo-intelligence. Based on several paradigm indications as deﬁned by Kuhn and based on an analysis of peer-reviewed scientiﬁc literature we conclude that GEOBIA is a new and evolving paradigm.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing imagery needs to be converted into tangible information which can be utilised in conjunction with other data sets, often within widely used Geographic Information Systems (GIS). As long as pixel sizes remained typically coarser than, or at the best, similar in size to the objects of interest, emphasis was placed on per-pixel analysis, or even sub-pixel analysis for this conversion, but with increasing spatial resolutions alternative paths have been followed, aimed at deriving objects that are made up of several pixels. This paper gives an overview of the development of object based methods, which aim to delineate readily usable objects from imagery while at the same time combining image processing and GIS functionalities in order to utilize spectral and contextual information in an integrative way. The most common approach used for building objects is image segmentation, which dates back to the 1970s. Around the year 2000 GIS and image processing started to grow together rapidly through object based image analysis (OBIA - or GEOBIA for geospatial object based image analysis). In contrast to typical Landsat resolutions, high resolution images support several scales within their images. Through a comprehensive literature review several thousand abstracts have been screened, and more than 820 OBIA-related articles comprising 145 journal papers, 84 book chapters and nearly 600 conference papers, are analysed in detail. It becomes evident that the first years of the OBIA/GEOBIA developments were characterised by the dominance of ‘grey’ literature, but that the number of peer-reviewed journal articles has increased sharply over the last four to five years. The pixel paradigm is beginning to show cracks and the OBIA methods are making considerable progress towards a spatially explicit information extraction workflow, such as is required for spatial planning as well as for many monitoring programmes.},

However, its application is mainly based on expert knowledge, which consequently highlights important scientiﬁc issues with respect to the robustness of the methods applied in GEOBIA. In this paper, we argue that GEOBIA would beneﬁt from another technical enhancement involving knowledge representation techniques such as ontologies. Although the role of ontologies in Geographical Information Sciences (GISciences) is not a new topic, few works have discussed how ontologies, considered from the perspective of a remote sensing specialist, can contribute to advancing remote sensing science. We summarize the main applications of ontologies in GEOBIA, especially for data discovery, automatic image interpretation, data interoperability, workﬂow management and data publication. Finally, we discuss the major issues related to the construction of ontologies suitable for remote sensing applications and outline long-term future advances that can be expected for the remote sensing community.},

	abstract = {The mechanical deformation of sea ice has substantial influence over large-scale (e.g., {\textgreater}10 km) ice properties, such as the ice thickness distribution, as well as small-scale (e.g., {\textless}50 m) features, including leads and ridges. The conditions leading to sea ice fracture are frequently studied in the context of a uniform ice sheet. Natural sea ice, however, is highly heterogeneous and riddled with flaws. Failure occurs primarily as brittle fracture localized in space and time where stresses, and strain rates, locally exceed failure criteria. Here we seek to better understand the mechanical deformation and fracture of sea ice under such typical field conditions. In particular, we aim to characterize how forces propagate across an approximately 1 km 2 heterogeneous domain by observing the stress-strain field in an ice floe at resolutions required to capture pre-fracture elastic strains. The combination of instruments deployed allow a detailed view of the formation, propagation, parting, and subsequent shearing of a fracture in natural sea ice, providing field evidence of modes of failure in compressive shear. The ability of this system to capture strain concentration zones and to detect initial fracture hours prior to lead formation indicates the potential for predicting areas at high risk for fracture in an on-ice operational setting.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Over the last decade, the Southern Ocean has experienced episodes of severe sea ice area decline. Abrupt events of sea ice loss are challenging to predict, in part due to incomplete understanding of processes occurring at the scale of individual ice floes. Here, we use high-resolution altimetry (ICESat-2) to quantify the seasonal life cycle of floes in the perennial sea ice pack of the Weddell Sea. The evolution of the floe chord distribution (FCD) shows an increase in the proportion of smaller floes between November and February, which coincides with the asymmetric melt–freeze cycle of the pack. The freeboard ice thickness distribution (fITD) suggests mirrored seasonality between the western and southern sections of the Weddell Sea ice cover, with an increasing proportion of thicker floes between October and March in the south and the opposite in the west. Throughout the seasonal cycle, there is a positive correlation between the mean chord length of floes and their average freeboard thickness. Composited floe profiles reveal that smaller floes are more vertically round than larger floes and that the mean roundness of floes increases during the melt season. These results show that regional differences in ice concentration and type at larger scales occur in conjunction with different behaviors at the small scale. We therefore suggest that floe-derived metrics obtained from altimetry could provide useful diagnostics for floe-aware models and improve our understanding of sea ice processes across scales.},

After achieving final orbit, MODIS began earth observations in late February 2000 and has been acquiring data since that time. The instrument is also being flown on the Aqua spacecraft, launched in May 2002. A comprehensive set of remote sensing algorithms for cloud detection and the retrieval of cloud physical and optical properties have been developed by members of the MODIS atmosphere science team. The archived products from these algorithms have applications in climate change studies, climate modeling, numerical weather prediction, as well as fundamental atmospheric research. In addition to an extensive cloud mask, products include cloud-top properties (temperature, pressure, effective emissivity), cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud optical and microphysical parameters (optical thickness, effective particle radius, water path), as well as derived statistics. We will describe the various algorithms being used for the remote sensing of cloud properties from MODIS data with an emphasis on the pixel-level retrievals (referred to as Level-2 products), with 1-km or 5-km spatial resolution at nadir. An example of each Level-2 cloud product from a common data granule (5 min of data) off the coast of South America will be discussed. Future efforts will also be mentioned. Relevant points related to the global gridded statistics products (Level-3) are highlighted though additional details are given in an accompanying paper in this issue.},

Most of the modifications are realized for nighttime scenes where polar and oceanic regions will see marked improvement. For polar night scenes, two new spectral tests using the 7.2- m water vapor absorption band have been added as well as updates to the 3.9–12- and 11–12- m cloud tests. More non-MODIS ancillary input data have been added. Land and sea surface temperature maps provide crucial information for mid- and low-level cloud detection and lessen dependence on ocean brightness temperature variability tests. Sun-glint areas are also improved by use of sea surface temperatures to aid in resolving observations with conflicting cloud versus clear-sky signals, where visible and near-infrared (NIR) reflectances are high, but infrared brightness temperatures are relatively warm. Day and night Arctic cloud frequency results are compared to those created by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Polar Pathfinder-Extended (APP-X) algorithm. Day versus night sea surface temperatures derived from MODIS radiances and using only the MODIS cloud mask for cloud screening are contrasted. Frequencies of cloud from sun-glint regions are shown as a function of sun-glint angle to gain a sense of cloud mask quality in those regions. Continuing validation activities are described in Part II of this paper.},

	abstract = {A method for automated classiﬁcation of surface and cloud types using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) radiance measurements has been developed. The MODIS cloud mask is used to deﬁne the training sets. Surface and cloud-type classiﬁcation is based on the maximum likelihood (ML) classiﬁcation method. Initial classiﬁcation results deﬁne training sets for subsequent iterations. Iterations end when the number of pixels switching classes becomes smaller than a predetermined number or when other criteria are met. The mean vector in the spectral and spatial domain within a class is used for class identiﬁcation, and a ﬁnal 1-kmresolution classiﬁcation mask is generated for such a ﬁeld of view in a MODIS granule. This automated classiﬁcation reﬁnes the output of the cloud mask algorithm and enables further applications such as clear atmospheric proﬁle or cloud parameter retrievals from MODIS and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) radiance measurements. The advantages of this method are that the automated surface and cloud-type classiﬁcations are independent of radiance or brightness temperature threshold criteria, and that the interpretation of each class is based on the radiative spectral characteristics of different classes. This paper describes the ML classiﬁcation algorithm and presents daytime MODIS classiﬁcation results. The classiﬁcation results are compared with the MODIS cloud mask, visible images, infrared window images, and other observations for an initial validation.},

In addition, AIRS and CCL cloud phase occurrences are evaluated seasonally, zonally, and with respect to total column water vapor (TCWV) and the temperature difference between 1000 and 300 hPa (DT10002300). Last, collocated MODIS cloud information is implemented in a 1-month case study to assess the relationship between AIRS and CCL phase decisions, cloud cover, and cloud phase throughout the AIRS FOV. Depending on the surface type, AIRS classiﬁcation skill for single-layer ice and liquid-phase clouds is over the ranges of 85\%–95\% and 22\%–32\%, respectively. Most unknown and liquid AIRS phase classiﬁcations correspond to mixed-phase clouds. AIRS ice-phase relative occurrence is biased low relative to CCL. However, the liquid-phase relative occurrence is similar between the two instruments. When compared with the CCL climatology, AIRS accurately represents the seasonal cycle of liquid and ice cloud phase across the Arctic as well as the relationship between cloud phase and TCWV and DT10002300 regime in some cases. The more heterogeneous the MODIS cloud macrophysical properties within an AIRS FOV are, the more likely it is that the AIRS FOV is classiﬁed as unknown phase.},

Hybrid cloud-masking using both the MOD35 mask and a visibility mask, combined with downscaling of Bands 3–7 to 250 m, are utilized to delineate sea ice extent using a decision tree approach. IceMap250 was tested on scenes from the freeze-up, stable cover, and melt seasons in the Hudson Bay complex, in Northeastern Canada. IceMap250 ﬁrst product is a daily composite sea ice presence map at 250 m. Validation based on comparisons with photo-interpreted ground-truth show the ability of the algorithm to achieve high classiﬁcation accuracy, with kappa values systematically over 90\%. IceMap250 second product is a weekly clear sky map that provides a synthesis of 7 days of daily composite maps. This map, produced using a majority ﬁlter, makes the sea ice presence map even more accurate by ﬁltering out the effects of isolated classiﬁcation errors. The synthesis maps show spatial consistency through time when compared to passive microwave and national ice services maps.},

    abstract = {Sea ice modulates the energy exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean through its kinematics. Marginal ice zone (MIZ) dynamics are complex and are not well resolved in routine observations. Here, we investigate sea ice dynamics in the Greenland Sea MIZ using in situ and remote sensing Lagrangian drift datasets. These datasets provide a unique view into ice dynamics spanning spatial scales. We find evidence of tidal currents strongly affecting sub-daily ice motion. Velocity anomalies show abrupt transitions aligned with gradients in seafloor topography, indicating changes in ocean currents. Remote-sensed ice floe trajectories derived from moderate resolution satellite imagery provide a view of small-scale variability across the Greenland continental shelf. Ice floe trajectories reveal a west-east increasing velocity gradient imposed by  the East Greenland Current, with maximum velocities aligned along the continental shelf edge. These results highlight the importance of small scale ocean variability for ice dynamics in the MIZ.},
